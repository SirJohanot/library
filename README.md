# library
A web application that simulates a library, complete with an account system, multiple user roles (reader, librarian, administrator) and a responsive layout, built using Java Servlets, Maven, MySQL, Log4J2 and JSP technologies. Launched and tested using Apache Tomcat. JUnit and Mockito are used for unit tests. Reflects my knowledge of Java Core, HTML+CSS, OOP, Code Conventions, Layered Architecture and SOLID principles.
